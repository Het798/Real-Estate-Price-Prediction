# 🏡 Real Estate Price Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes California housing data and builds predictive models to estimate median house values based on neighborhood features.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Engineer new features like rooms per household
- Train and evaluate regression models
- Compare Linear Regression vs. XGBoost
- Visualize predictions, residuals, and feature importance
- Save trained models for reuse
